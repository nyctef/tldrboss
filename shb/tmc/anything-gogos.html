      <h1>Act 1</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Mimic: do not attack Gogo while he has the Mimicry buff.</li>
        <li>
          Mimicked Sap: Evade the first AoE, then <em>keep running</em> for two
          more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mimicked Doom Impeding: Get full health before the cast completes.
        </li>
        <li>Mimicked Bunshin: Avoid some more AoEs</li>
        <li>
          Mimicked Raw Instinct: Extra damage. Can be ignored, or remove with
          Eerie Soundwave.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Act 2</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gogo Fire III: Cease all action when you get the Pyretic debuff.
        </li>
        <li>Gogo Blizzard III: Point-blank AoE on the boss.</li>
        <li>
          Gogo Thunder III: Is cast next. Leaves a damaging puddle; can be
          baited towards the edge of the arena.
        </li>
        <li>Gogo Flare -> Gogo Holy: Heal up after each.</li>
        <li>
          Gogo Meteor: Two successive proximity AoEs at opposite ends of the

          <em>Diamondback</em> around the time the second meteor lands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Charybdis + Icestorm: Avoid two, then four large persistent AoEs at
          the edges. Cleanse two debuffs immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gogo Thunder III: Now fires three times in succession. Try to bait the
          AoEs into the gaps between the tornados.
