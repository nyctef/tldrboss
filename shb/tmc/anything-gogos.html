        <h2>Act 2</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gogo Fire III: Move away from the boss during the cast, then
            <em>cease all action</em> when you get the Pyretic debuff.
          </li>
          <li>Gogo Blizzard III: Point-blank AoE on the boss.</li>
          <li>
            Gogo Thunder III: Is cast next. Leaves a damaging puddle; can be
            baited towards the edge of the arena.
          </li>
          <li>Gogo Flare -> Gogo Holy: Heal up after each.</li>
          <li>
            Gogo Meteor: Move away from the first proximity marker. Dodge random
            AoEs. Move to the center, and cast
            <em>Diamondback</em> before or as the second meteor lands to tank
            the third.<br />
            ⚠ Warning: stay out of melee range of Gogo while casting
            Diamondback, or he might interrupt it!
          </li>
          <li>
            Charybdis + Icestorm: Avoid two, then four large persistent AoEs at
            the edges. Cleanse two debuffs immediately, then move into a gap
            between tornados. <br />
            ⚠ Warning: the tornado AoEs are slightly larger than the visuals!
            Give them plenty of space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gogo Thunder III: Now fires three times in succession. Bait the AoEs
            into the gaps between the tornados. Move away into the remaining
            space to avoid another Gogo Fire + Blizzard combo.
          </li>
        </ul>
